\caption{Details of the eight models fitted in the chromosome evolution analyses.}\\ 
  
\hline
\textbf{Model name} & \textbf{Rate parameters estimated} & \textbf{Interpretation} \tabularnewline
\hline
CONST\_RATE &
(i) gain, 
(ii) loss,
(iii) polyploidy &
Chromosome numbers change either through gain or loss of single chromosomes, or via whole genome duplication. \tabularnewline

\hline

CONST\_RATE\_DEMI &
(i) gain, 
(ii) loss, 
(iii) polyploidy = (iv) demipolyploidy &
Chromosome numbers change either through gain or loss of single chromosomes, or via whole genome duplication and half genome duplication. However, the rates of whole genome and half genome duplication are equal.\tabularnewline

\hline

CONST\_RATE\_DEMI\_EST &
(i) gain,  
(ii) loss, 
(iii) polyploidy,  
(iv) demipolyploidy &
Chromosome numbers change either through gain or loss of single chromosomes, or via whole genome duplication and half genome duplication. \tabularnewline

\hline

LINEAR\_RATE &
(i) gain,  
(ii) loss, 
(iii) polyploidy, 
(v) gain linear, 
(vi) loss linear &
Chromosome numbers change either through gain or loss of single chromosomes, or via whole genome duplication. Rates for single chromosome gain or loss are dependent on the current chromosome number. \tabularnewline
